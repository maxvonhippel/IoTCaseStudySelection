Scripts used for selecting apps to model in my senior thesis at the University of Arizona.  `dataset.py` implements *Algorithm 1* from the manuscript, and selects a set of `N` apps from a dataset of Groovy (Samsung SmartThings) apps to study, with maximum hidden interdependency.  `scalability.sh` performs simple scalability analysis on the algorithm using `dataset.py`; to use it you will need to tweak it in obvious ways to fit your directory structure.
